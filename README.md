## Overview

The software simulates the formation of three-dimensional packings of spherical and non-spherical (regular and irregular) particles with prescribed size distributions. An efficient approach to create multiple realizations of non-spherical irregularly shaped particles using coherent noise modification of the spherical particle surface is introduced. The simulator generates loose and dense granular packings of prescribed shape and size distributions. Examples of what is possible to produce are below.

## Requirements

The compiled software was tested on multiple Windows 10 machines. To compile the source code, [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/) is required. Version 2017.1.3 is recommended. Hardware requirements depend on the desired number of particles in the packings generated. A typical laptop specification would be suitable for 5000-10000 particles. 

## Getting started

The compiled version uses a parameter file to define the simulation parameters. The source code can be ran inside Unity and the same parameters can be modified in the platform. Please check the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/MosGeo/ParticlePack/wiki) for detailed information.
