Changes:
- Disabled surface area calculation pending calculation optimizations
- Realistic grains calculations of the convex hull added to improve results.

Fixes:
- First a bug where fining and coarsening upward where switched.
- Fining upward had a bug that resulted in a very small grain at the last depeosition step for the grain group.
- Fixed a bug in coloring grains based on size.
